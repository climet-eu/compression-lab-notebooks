# Our Vision: Fearless Lossy Compression

Adopting lossy compression can be scary. Nobody wants to loose important real information when compressing their data. We want to make lossy compression fearless for weather and climate scientists so you specifically and we as a community can all benefit from higher compression ratios.

We are working on the following three steps:

1. Establish **lossy compression requirements** based on which compression errors we can tolerate in general and for specific usecases. This tolerance depends e.g. on the variable and any uncertainty it carries from its measurement or modelling.

2. **Benchmark** existing compression methods to identify which ones provide the **best performance** (compression ratio, computational cost, ...) while meeting the above requirements.

3. Provide **recommendations** for which compression methods to adopt.


## We need Your help!

We are reaching out to identify and take into account your requirements for lossy data compression. If you have a few minutes to spare, please contribute by

1. Select one or more field variables that you work with

2. Fill in or leave comments for one or more of
   - the variable's distribution
   - the inherent uncertainty/error from measurements and modelling
   - your requirements for the $L_1$ (MAE), $L_2$ (RMSE), $L_{\infty}$ (max), relative (%), and budget error bounds
   - any further requirements you have

We appreciate your time in helping specify the requirements our community has for lossy data compression!
